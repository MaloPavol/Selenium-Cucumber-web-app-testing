# Automated Web App Testing
This project is a package of all components needed to run automated tests of web applications on Selenium and Cucumber with a small demonstrative test case (submitting data through a [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) sample form). 

This App was produced during my master degree Software Design and Engineering at [University of Applied Sciences FH Campus Wien](https://www.fh-campuswien.ac.at/en/studies/study-courses/detail/software-design-and-engineering-master.html).
